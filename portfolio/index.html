        <h1>Tamunomiete Adina Barimalaa</h1>
        <p>I build things for the web — from pixel-perfect interfaces to logic-driven back ends. As a front-end and back-end developer, I bridge design and functionality to craft digital experiences that work beautifully across devices.
        <p>With a toolkit that includes semantic HTML, CSS styling, and JavaScript wizardry, I focus on clean code and intuitive UI. I collaborate using Git and GitHub, thrive in the command line, and keep responsiveness and accessibility front of mind. My backend work draws on Python fundamentals and a problem-solving mindset shaped by curiosity and a love for clarity.</p>
        <p>Whether I’m styling a button or structuring an API, I aim for thoughtful simplicity because the best solutions often hide in the details.</p>
